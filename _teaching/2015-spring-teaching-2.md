These are some ideas on how to write

Theory and empirics
======

Students sometimes begin with so much theory that they cannot think empirically.  
Once we start working empirically, the project may change — that is not a problem. It is part of the process.

More or less
======

Writing more is generally **not** better than writing less.  
Adding paragraphs often makes the good ideas harder to find.  
Conciseness and clarity are your allies.

Structure and progress
======

We should have some structure to the process — for example, you write new material, and we meet regularly. But this is not an accounting exercise. You will not complete *N/M* of the project after *N* of *M* weeks.

Ideas, luck, and inspiration will play their part.  

Keep working, and I will help make sure it all checks out in the end.
