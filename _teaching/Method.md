Relationships Between Variables

In scholarly work, we often set out to show that there is a relationship between X and Y for one or more cases.

* We may want to show that when X is false/true, Y is false/true;
* when X is 0 or 1, Y is 0 or 1;
* when X increases, Y increases -

these would all be examples of relationships between an independent and a dependent variable.

The case of no relationship would be X changes but Y remains constant.

Relationship between X and Y

| Y | X = 0 | X = 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Y = 0 |  |  |
| Y = 1 |  |  |
|  | X | |
| --- | --- | --- |

The case of no relationship would be X changes but Y remains constant.

A research design would require a minimum of two cases, and can have many more. We would need a case of X=0 and of X=1, or X low and of X high. For each of these, we will set out to find out the values of Y which we expect to be related to X.

In a case-study design, we have information on X and Y from two or more cases.

In a large-N design, we have many more - say, more than 50.

A medium-N design would be something in-between.

In a large-N design, we may take advantage of statistical techniques, to demonstrate that X and Y are related.

A case could be a country,

* if you wanted to know why different countries go to war, or run a budget deficit.

A case could be individuals,

* in surveys, we ask people how they feel about things, positing a relationship between say a person's sense of job security and that person's tendency to vote left or right.

Data

You can simply read to infer the values of your data

* books, government docs, and newspaper articles. You can simply cite those and declare that X and Y for a particular case have certain specific values.

You can also generate your data by asking people things

* by running your own survey.

You can download existing data

* usually in the form of something like a spreadsheet.

Bottomline

All research designs are:

* comparative in nature,
* all inference from your data is based on empirical variation between cases.

Whether you have two cases, or thousands of cases

* you are comparing how the dependent variable varies as your independent variable changes.

You can attach many other descriptions to your method:

* most-similar or most-different design, interviews, observational or experimental, over time, panel, etc.,
* you can find some methods more or less compelling.

The above statements will continue to describe the basic logic of all research.
