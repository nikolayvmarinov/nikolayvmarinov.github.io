Machine-Learning to Classify Images
======

Oct 10 2025 - Nikolay Marinov - Machine-Learning to Classify Images:

Beginner-friendly workshop introducing how machine learning can be used to analyze and classify images — from detecting faces and identifying objects to training simple models that distinguish between categories such as male and female politicians’ social media banner images. Using Google Colab and Python libraries like OpenCV, Hugging Face’s transformers, and PyTorch, participants learn the full workflow: setting up datasets, applying pre-trained models for visual recognition, labeling and training supervised models, and evaluating performance metrics like accuracy and F1 scores. We use the social media banner pictures of members of the European Parliament.
