## Dissertation on sanctions

* I wrote my dissertation on economic sanctions:
  * I wanted to know why political rivalry makes it hard to end economic sanctions.
* Since then, I have also asked:
  * whether sanctions destablize leaders
  * whether individual sanctions cause elite defections in autocratic regimes.


## Interest in how the outside world changes democracy 

* Sanctions are one way to influence the affairs of others, and building democracy abroad is an overriding interest of Western Powers. I want to know: 
  * whether election observation helps clean elections,
  * what intervenining in other countries' elections does, 
  * whether the declining ability of mass moblization to produce democracy can be traced to declining support from abroad. 

##  New data to study democracy

* To get to the role of the international community in spreading liberalization, new data collections are needed. I have spear-headed efforts to:  
  * collect information on all elections around the world, regardless of their democratic quality (important to avoid selecting on the dependent variable of liberalization if we are to understand the causes of it),
  * collect information on how states intervene in elections, 
  * collect information on how international factors affect protests. 

##  I come from Bulgaria

* So I want to know:  
  * what causes corruption - for example, governments stealing aid after floods,
  * can social media help stop government theft of natural resources? 
  * how does the government steal elections? 

##  Authoritarians

* Authoritarian regimes are fascinating. I want to know:  
  * why they spread conspiracy theories,
  * why they sometimes stage show trials and sometimes deploy blackouts in the aftermath of accidents and natural disasters?
