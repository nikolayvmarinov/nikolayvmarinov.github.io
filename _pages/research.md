## Dissertation on sanctions

* I wrote my dissertation on economic sanctions:
  * I wanted to know why political rivalry makes it hard to end economic sanctions.
* Since then, I have looked at:
  * whether sanctions destablize leaders
  * whether individual sanctions cause elite defections in autocratic regimes


## Interest in how the outside world changes democracy 

* Sanctions are one way to influence others, and building democracy abroad is an overriding interest of Western Powers. I want to know: 
  * whether foreign pressure reverses coups,
  * whether intervenining in other countries' elections works, 
  * whether mass moblization no longer leads to democracy because of dwindling outside support

##  New data to study democracy

* To get to the role of the international community in spreading liberalization, new data collections are needed. I have spearheaded efforts to collect data on:  
  * all elections around the world, regardless of their democratic quality,
  * how states intervene in elections, 
  * how international factors affect protests 

##  I come from Bulgaria

* So I want to know:  
  * what causes corruption - for example, governments stealing aid after floods,
  * can social media help stop government theft of public resources? 
  * how does the government steal elections? 

##  Authoritarians

* Authoritarian regimes are fascinating. I want to know:  
  * why they spread conspiracy theories,
  * why they sometimes stage show trials and sometimes deploy blackouts in the aftermath of accidents and natural disasters
