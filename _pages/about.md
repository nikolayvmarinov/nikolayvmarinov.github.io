I am a political scientist studying how international and domestic forces shape democracy. My work explores elections, disinformation, foreign interventions, and the strategies that sustain or undermine democratic governance. I use experiments, text analysis, and cross-national data to understand how political actors—both at home and abroad—compete for influence.

Before joining the University of Gothenburg, I held positions at the University of Houston, the University of Mannheim, and Yale University. My research has appeared in journals such as The American Journal of Political Science, The Journal of Politics, Comparative Political Studies, and International Organization.

At Gothenburg, I teach democratization, institutional development, and data science, and I coordinate initiatives that connect political science with data science. I am a public intellectual in my home town Varna.
