I am a political scientist studying how international and domestic forces shape democracy. My work explores elections, disinformation, foreign interventions, and the strategies that sustain or undermine democratic governance. I use experiments, text analysis, and cross-national data to understand how political actors—both at home and abroad—compete for influence.

Before joining the University of Gothenburg, I held positions at the University of Houston, the University of Mannheim, and Yale University.

At Gothenburg, I teach democratization, institutional development, and data science. I am a public intellectual in my home town Varna.
